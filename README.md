E-commerce Analysis

Hello, everyone!
I'm excited to showcase my first Power BI Project Report(E- Commerce) that I mastered crafting during the live training at Microsoft Project, under the expert guidance of Akshay Kamble Sir. Analyzing Sales and Revenue Performance with Precision. Dive into a comprehensive exploration of our E-Commerce journey, where data-driven insights illuminate the path to success.

📊Overview Page: The overview page is the Initial page of my dashboard which is intentionally designed to be simple, featuring three essential KPIs and a smart narrative that encapsulates the entire report.

💼Sales Page: Explore valuable insights into key business metrics and performance indicators at a glance. Utilize interactive features, such as tooltips, to delve deeper into location details and make data-driven decisions.

📈Product Page: Dive into product-specific analytics, analyzing sales, trends, and customer behavior. Additionally, I've added a drill-down page to enable further exploration of products, categories, and subcategories for comprehensive insights.

👥Employee Page: Gain comprehensive workforce analytics, tracking employee performance and engagement. Leverage tooltips to access additional information and optimize your understanding of the data.

🔍Drilldown Page: I have included a detailed drill-down page that showcases products, enabling a closer assessment of their performance and growth. To ensure important KPIs remain unaffected, I have utilized the Edit Interaction feature on this page.

🔒Hidden Slicers: Slicers play a crucial role in data analysis, so I've creatively used hidden slicers to enhance the outlook of the dashboard.

📝Tooltip: Customized tooltips add depth to reports, providing valuable insights. I've created interactive and engaging tooltips to enrich the dashboard designs.

🎨Background Design: The background design was crafted using Canva, ensuring an appealing and professional appearance.
